Pretty Low Impact
Davis Rao
----------------
This is a blog page for people that want to find simple ways to both be low impact on the environment, as well as stay up to speed on the news of the 'green' movement. This is a page that is useful for anyone from cooks, business people, people interested in business, or people that want to overall be low impact in easy ways. 
----------------
### Frameworks Used
----------------
THis was built using HTML5 for structures and wireframe layouts
CSS3 was used for styling the pages and any animations that happen throughout, and JQuery was used for reactions upon user interaction 
Bootstrap for responsiveness based on screen size


Pages included in this Document
----------------
Home: Cover page including button to enter the site, and a quick tagline

Bio: Bio on the blogger herself, what drove her to this, and another button to bring you to the actual page. CSS animation employed here There are nav links here that can take you to other pages, as well as a hamburger holding the nav links on smaller screens

Links: These are quick links that take you to recipes (vegetarian), business news about the green movement, as well as fashion tips that could be pointing you to low impact companies or anything else. Jquery was employed here to show and hide the relevant information on clicks. There are nav links here that can take you to other pages, as well as a hamburger holding the nav links on smaller screens. 

Contact Us: This is a WuFoo form that will, once the site is live, allow the user to input the contact information to sign up for site updates.There are nav links here that can take you to other pages, as well as a hamburger holding the nav links on smaller screens


### Key Next Steps
------------------
It would be cool to include a blog along with this, but that would obviously require somebody keeping up with it pretty thoroughly.

I would also like to add in the fashion links, as well as clean up the animation and scrolling on click that the site currently employs.

## Acknowledgments

Initial User Stories



When i enter this site, the first thing that I see is the background of wilderness and trees and immediately think of the outdoors. The websites color scheme and pictures are meant to feel like youre hiking

I notice the logo in the top left and the nav bar on top with links to the blog, news, and an about page. the news will be just a page of article links, photos and descriptions. the about page will be an about page about the author.

I first see the tagline on the top of the first section explaining something about the site. some one-phrase explanation of the blog. Eyes are drawn to thecenter of the background photo on the top div where there is a button to read more. when you press the button, a toolbar at the bottom that has been visible but not expanded, pops up and has 3 divs inside of it, with background pictures. There are words and titles of each blog name, and from left to right it goes most recent to older.

as you continue to scroll down the page there can be submit forms for emails, but the page is pretty simple to reflect the idea of the blog

When you click on one of these divs, it takes you to a seperate page that is a blog post (which can also be reached by nav bar clicking). underneath this full blog post are listed in order of recency, the other posts.
