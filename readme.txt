when i enter this site, the first thing that I see is the background of wilderness and trees and immediately think of the outdoors. The websites color scheme and pictures are meant to feel like youre hiking

I notice the logo in the top left and the nav bar on top with links to the blog, news, and an about page. the news will be just a page of article links, photos and descriptions. the about page will be an about page about the author.

I first see the tagline on the top of the first section explaining something about the site. some one-phrase explanation of the blog. Eyes are drawn to thecenter of the background photo on the top div where there is a button to read more. when you press the button, a toolbar at the bottom that has been visible but not expanded, pops up and has 3 divs inside of it, with background pictures. There are words and titles of each blog name, and from left to right it goes most recent to older.

as you continue to scroll down the page there can be submit forms for emails, but the page is pretty simple to reflect the idea of the blog

When you click on one of these divs, it takes you to a seperate page that is a blog post (which can also be reached by nav bar clicking). underneath this full blog post are listed in order of recency, the other posts.
